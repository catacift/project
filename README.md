# Wind Energy + AI for Rural Schools in San Diego

This project, developed by Catalina Cifuentes, combines artificial intelligence and open data to provide renewable energy and digital connectivity solutions to rural schools in San Diego County.

## 🔍 Project Structure

- `project.py`: base model for wind power production forecasting  
- `rural_schools/`: code to identify vulnerable schools and propose technical solutions  
- `data/`: downloaded datasets (wind, schools, digital coverage)  
- `docs/`: supporting documents (technical briefs, maps, reports)  

## 🧪 Components

- Geographic mapping with vulnerability clustering  
- Wind forecasting models using AI (XGBoost, RandomForest)  
- Estimation of energy demand per school  
- Visualizations of energy supply vs. demand  
- Pilot implementation in Campo, CA  

## 🌎 Objective

To help close the energy and digital divide in rural communities through an approach centered on energy justice, inclusive education, and clean technologies.
